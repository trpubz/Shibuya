# Shibuya
Xcode Theme -- Shibuya

This is not my Xcode Theme.  I found this theme on Medium by author **Sean Choo** (Late 2021) who has since deleted his article.  I wanted this theme on my second machine and was forced to figure out how to export an .xccolortheme file.

Sean had laid out the logic behind this alternative Light Mode Theme and while I can't remember the justifications, the mere fact he wrote 450 words explaining why his **_Shibuya_** Theme is superior had me convinced.  So here it is and thanks Sean!

## Installation

If you haven't already done so, create a `FontAndColorThemes` directory inside of Xcode's `UserData` folder:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
```

Then simply download this project and copy the [Shibuya](./Shibuya.xccolortheme) file to the `FontAndColorThemes` directory:

```sh
cp Shibuya.xccolortheme ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/
```


Restart Xcode and head into `Preferences` > `Themes`, and select `Shibuya` from the list of theme options.
